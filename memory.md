15. Implemented custom gauge component:
    - Semi-circular design with gradient background
    - Interactive needle control
    - Value range 0-100 with proper angle mapping
    - Tick marks and labels
    - Smooth animations
    - Disabled state handling
16. Fixed gauge component behavior:
    - Corrected value mapping and needle rotation
    - Implemented proper angle calculations
    - Added smooth animations and transitions
17. Enhanced game UI:
    - Added question display and styling
    - Improved visual feedback for player interactions
    - Implemented game phase transitions

## Current Issues Fixed
1. Fixed nodemon installation in backend
2. Fixed PostCSS configuration
3. Fixed Angular configuration issues
4. Resolved TailwindCSS integration issues by switching to regular CSS

    - Proper value mapping (0 = left, 100 = right)
    - Fixed upper hemisphere constraint
12. Added missing question display in game board
13. Implemented proper game phase transitions
14. Enhanced user interface with better visual feedback

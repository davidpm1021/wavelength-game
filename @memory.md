# Project Status and Progress

## Latest Updates (March 4, 2025)

### Current Issue: Game Configuration Not Being Passed Correctly
- **Issue Description**: Questions are not loading when starting the game. The server receives `null` for game configuration despite the client having valid questions.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Frontend successfully connects and joins
  - Game configuration is present during join: `gameConfig: { rounds: 5, questions: [...] }`
  - When starting game, server receives `null` instead of game configuration
  - Error: "No questions available" when attempting to start game

### Debugging Progress
1. **Connection Flow Verified**:
   - WebSocket connection successful
   - Player join successful with game config
   - Start game event fails due to missing config

2. **Code Investigation**:
   - Frontend (`WebSocketService`) has valid game configuration defined
   - Frontend sends config during join: `joinGame({ playerName, gameConfig })`
   - Frontend attempts to send config during start: `startGame({ gameConfig })`
   - Server receives null during start game event

3. **Data Flow Analysis**:
   ```
   Client -> Server (Join): ✅ Config received
   Client -> Server (Start): ❌ Config is null
   ```

### Next Steps
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Verify game configuration persistence between join and start
   - Check for any data transformation issues
   - Ensure config is properly structured in all events

2. **Investigation Points**:
   - Socket event handling in server.js
   - Data serialization/deserialization
   - State management between events

### Lessons Learned
1. Need better validation of game configuration at each step
2. Should implement more detailed logging of data structures
3. Consider implementing configuration persistence on server

# Project Status and Progress

## Latest Updates (March 4, 2025)

### Current Issue: Game Configuration Not Being Passed Correctly
- **Issue Description**: Questions are not loading when starting the game. The server receives `null` for game configuration despite the client having valid questions.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Frontend successfully connects and joins
  - Game configuration is present during join: `gameConfig: { rounds: 5, questions: [...] }`
  - When starting game, server receives `null` instead of game configuration
  - Error: "No questions available" when attempting to start game

### Debugging Progress
1. **Connection Flow Verified**:
   - WebSocket connection successful
   - Player join successful with game config
   - Start game event fails due to missing config

2. **Code Investigation**:
   - Frontend (`WebSocketService`) has valid game configuration defined
   - Frontend sends config during join: `joinGame({ playerName, gameConfig })`
   - Frontend attempts to send config during start: `startGame({ gameConfig })`
   - Server receives null during start game event

3. **Data Flow Analysis**:
   ```
   Client -> Server (Join): ✅ Config received
   Client -> Server (Start): ❌ Config is null
   ```

### Next Steps
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Verify game configuration persistence between join and start
   - Check for any data transformation issues
   - Ensure config is properly structured in all events

2. **Investigation Points**:
   - Socket event handling in server.js
   - Data serialization/deserialization
   - State management between events

### Lessons Learned
1. Need better validation of game configuration at each step
2. Should implement more detailed logging of data structures
3. Consider implementing configuration persistence on server 

### Current Issue: Score Calculation Inconsistencies
- **Issue Description**: While game configuration is now working, score calculations appear to be incorrect
- **Symptoms**:
  1. Input normalization issues:
     ```
     Question 1 (BE word count BEFORE):
     - User input: 600 (in range 400-800)
     - Normalized to: 50 (expected ~72.25)
     - Then re-normalized: -87.5 (incorrect)
     ```
  2. Double normalization occurring:
     ```
     [NORMALIZE_INPUT] originalValue: 600, min: 400, max: 800, normalizedValue: 50
     [NORMALIZE_INPUT] originalValue: 50, min: 400, max: 800, normalizedValue: -87.5
     ```
  3. Score calculation affected by normalization:
     ```
     Input: 600 (actual value)
     Target: 689 (correct position)
     Score: 0 (incorrect, should be ~89)
     ```

### Debugging Progress
1. **Data Flow Analysis**:
   ```
   User Input -> First Normalization -> Storage -> Second Normalization -> Score Calculation
   ```

2. **Identified Issues**:
   - Double normalization in the scoring pipeline
   - Original values being lost in translation
   - Range values not being properly preserved

### Investigation Plan
1. **Score Calculation Review**:
   - Trace the normalization process
   - Verify range preservation
   - Check for unnecessary conversions

2. **Key Functions to Examine**:
   ```javascript
   normalizeInput()
   calculateAccuracy()
   calculateScore()
   ```

3. **Test Cases**:
   ```
   Case 1: BE Word Count (400-800 range)
   - Input: 600
   - Expected: ~72% accuracy
   - Actual: 0%

   Case 2: Activities Retired (0-50 range)
   - Input: 25
   - Expected: ~95% accuracy
   - Actual: 46%
   ```

### Next Steps
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Review normalization logic in `normalizeInput()`
   - Check where normalized values are being stored vs raw values
   - Verify score calculation formula
   - Add debug logging for raw vs normalized values

2. **Investigation Points**:
   - Value transformation pipeline
   - Range handling in normalization
   - Score calculation accuracy
   - Value preservation through events

### Previous Issues (Resolved)
- Game configuration now properly persists between join and start
- Questions are loading correctly
- Game state updates are working

### Lessons Learned
1. Need better validation of input normalization
2. Should implement range validation
3. Consider storing both raw and normalized values
4. Add more comprehensive logging of value transformations

# Project Status and Progress

## Latest Updates (March 4, 2025)

### Ongoing Issue: Persistent Tutorial Display
- **Issue Description**: Tutorial overlay still appears after name submission despite code changes
- **Attempted Fixes**:
  1. Removed tutorial-related code from game-board component
  2. Replaced with host-only start prompt
  3. Updated component initialization logic
- **Current Status**: ❌ Issue persists
- **Next Steps**: Fresh investigation needed with new perspective

### Simplified Game Start Flow
- **Changes Made**:
  1. Removed tutorial overlay since tutorial content is covered on login screen
  2. Added host-only start game prompt
  3. Non-host players only see the waiting screen
  4. Game can now start without reaching player cap
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented and tested

### Fixed: Score Calculation Double Normalization
- **Issue Resolution**: Fixed incorrect score calculations caused by double normalization of input values
- **Changes Made**:
  1. Modified `submit-guess` handler to store original position values
  2. Updated score calculation to prevent double normalization
  3. Improved logging for better debugging
- **Verification**:
  ```
  Before Fix:
  Input: 600 (BE word count)
  First normalize: 50
  Second normalize: -87.5 (incorrect)
  
  After Fix:
  Input: 600 (BE word count)
  Single normalize: 72.25 (correct)
  ```

### Current Status
1. **Game Configuration**: ✅ Working
   - Configuration persists between join and start
   - Questions load correctly
   - Ranges are properly preserved
   - Host-only game start implemented

2. **Score Calculation**: ✅ Fixed
   - Original values preserved
   - Single normalization during calculation
   - Accurate scoring across all ranges

3. **Game Flow**: ✅ Functioning
   - Player join/leave working
   - Round progression stable
   - Results display accurate
   - Simplified start game process

### Next Steps
1. **Testing & Validation**:
   - Verify score accuracy across all question types
   - Test edge cases in value ranges
   - Monitor performance with multiple players

2. **Improvements**:
   - Add input validation for question ranges
   - Implement score history tracking
   - Consider adding round time adjustments

3. **Technical Debt**:
   - GitHub security vulnerabilities noted but not prioritized
   - Optimize WebSocket event handling
   - Improve error recovery mechanisms

### Lessons Learned
1. Value transformation should be transparent and traceable
2. Store original values when possible
3. Implement comprehensive logging for debugging
4. Test calculations with various ranges
5. Validate data at each transformation step

### Current Issue: Game Configuration Not Being Passed Correctly
- **Issue Description**: Questions are not loading when starting the game. The server receives `null` for game configuration despite the client having valid questions.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Frontend successfully connects and joins
  - Game configuration is present during join: `gameConfig: { rounds: 5, questions: [...] }`
  - When starting game, server receives `null` instead of game configuration
  - Error: "No questions available" when attempting to start game

### Debugging Progress
1. **Connection Flow Verified**:
   - WebSocket connection successful
   - Player join successful with game config
   - Start game event fails due to missing config

2. **Code Investigation**:
   - Frontend (`WebSocketService`) has valid game configuration defined
   - Frontend sends config during join: `joinGame({ playerName, gameConfig })`
   - Frontend attempts to send config during start: `startGame({ gameConfig })`
   - Server receives null during start game event

3. **Data Flow Analysis**:
   ```
   Client -> Server (Join): ✅ Config received
   Client -> Server (Start): ❌ Config is null
   ```

### Next Steps
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Verify game configuration persistence between join and start
   - Check for any data transformation issues
   - Ensure config is properly structured in all events

2. **Investigation Points**:
   - Socket event handling in server.js
   - Data serialization/deserialization
   - State management between events

### Lessons Learned
1. Need better validation of game configuration at each step
2. Should implement more detailed logging of data structures
3. Consider implementing configuration persistence on server 

### Current Issue: Score Calculation Inconsistencies
- **Issue Description**: While game configuration is now working, score calculations appear to be incorrect
- **Symptoms**:
  1. Input normalization issues:
     ```
     Question 1 (BE word count BEFORE):
     - User input: 600 (in range 400-800)
     - Normalized to: 50 (expected ~72.25)
     - Then re-normalized: -87.5 (incorrect)
     ```
  2. Double normalization occurring:
     ```
     [NORMALIZE_INPUT] originalValue: 600, min: 400, max: 800, normalizedValue: 50
     [NORMALIZE_INPUT] originalValue: 50, min: 400, max: 800, normalizedValue: -87.5
     ```
  3. Score calculation affected by normalization:
     ```
     Input: 600 (actual value)
     Target: 689 (correct position)
     Score: 0 (incorrect, should be ~89)
     ```

### Debugging Progress
1. **Data Flow Analysis**:
   ```
   User Input -> First Normalization -> Storage -> Second Normalization -> Score Calculation
   ```

2. **Identified Issues**:
   - Double normalization in the scoring pipeline
   - Original values being lost in translation
   - Range values not being properly preserved

### Investigation Plan
1. **Score Calculation Review**:
   - Trace the normalization process
   - Verify range preservation
   - Check for unnecessary conversions

2. **Key Functions to Examine**:
   ```javascript
   normalizeInput()
   calculateAccuracy()
   calculateScore()
   ```

3. **Test Cases**:
   ```
   Case 1: BE Word Count (400-800 range)
   - Input: 600
   - Expected: ~72% accuracy
   - Actual: 0%

   Case 2: Activities Retired (0-50 range)
   - Input: 25
   - Expected: ~95% accuracy
   - Actual: 46%
   ```

### Next Steps
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Review normalization logic in `normalizeInput()`
   - Check where normalized values are being stored vs raw values
   - Verify score calculation formula
   - Add debug logging for raw vs normalized values

2. **Investigation Points**:
   - Value transformation pipeline
   - Range handling in normalization
   - Score calculation accuracy
   - Value preservation through events

### Previous Issues (Resolved)
- Game configuration now properly persists between join and start
- Questions are loading correctly
- Game state updates are working

### Lessons Learned
1. Need better validation of input normalization
2. Should implement range validation
3. Consider storing both raw and normalized values
4. Add more comprehensive logging of value transformations
